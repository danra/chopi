# preflight.sh -- pre-run checks for chopi, as functions chopi calls at two points.
#
# Sourced (never run directly). The checks are split by WHEN they can run, because chopi
# only learns the dir the command will actually run in partway through setup:
#   * preflight_initial          -- runnable up front: the workspace doesn't overlap chopi's
#                                   own dir (a confined command must not reach the policy
#                                   that confines it) or the proxy's run dir (whose ports aim
#                                   the holes), and the safehouse CLI is on PATH.
#   * preflight_config_placement -- deferred until chopi has resolved the workspace (the
#                                   --worktree target), since that is the dir a custom
#                                   --config must stay outside of.
